That's not nice for your fellow student, but it happens. For this reason reviews are automatically released after 2 hours. Restrictions​ To prevent 'cheating' and to promote good behavior, there are a number of restrictions on conducting reviews. If you do a review whilst you already have 5 credits you won't earn any credits. If you check the same person over and over, you often become a bit lax and less sharp after a number of reviews. As a reviewer, you cannot check a certain reviewee too often in a row! info Example: Suppose Bob has made 6 exercises and Claire has checked 2 of these 6 exercises.

So it's recommended for coaches to try and sample about 10% of all reviews that students do. This keeps students accountable as they know their reviews are not happening in a vacuum. And it allows you to validate that students are paying enough attention to the quality of each other's work. Review samples look the same as a normal review, you can select one that Jarvis recommends from the list below the normal reviews. Optionally you can go to any student's detail page, then go down to reviews and sample any specific review that they were involved in. Either from the accepted or declined tabs.  info You can only sample reviews that have been completed by other students. When accepting a review, you get the option of sending feedback to both the author and the reviewer. (only show if Chat within Jarvis is used) These feedbacks can be different from each other, allowing you to give taylored feedback for the role the person played in the review. note Currently it is not possible to accept a review that has been declined unjustly, the author will always need to submit the assignment again once a review has been declined. Rejecting a review sample that unjustly declined a review will not change the state of the exercise for the author When declining a sample you also get the ability to send feedback to both contributors, but on top of this you also get to select a severity of the issue. These range from minor to critical, with minor meaning only the reviewer made a small mistake, and critical being both contributors made grave errors and or showed negligence. The categories are as follows Severity\tCredits Deducted\tNeeds to redo exerciseMinor\t1\tNo Normal\t1\tYes Major\t3\tYes Critical\t5\tYes caution Both the author and the reviewer will be deducted the same amount of credits. In case this is not intended, you can manually adjust the credits for the person you want to penalise more (or less) severely note After declining a review sample the student will in addition to your feedback also receive as small notification.

"},{"title":"Editor​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Universe","url":"/docs/universe#editor","content":"Cloning a universe​ If you are currently using a universe from a different location, it means that you are not the owner of the universe. And cannot edit the universe. The universe will in fact update if the other location edits it. If you want to make changes to it, you can clone it. This means Jarvis will create a copy of the current universe and make it yours. caution You will no longer receive automatic updates of the old universe, and you will be responsible for updating / maintaining the flows. You can clone a universe by first switching the edit mode switch to on. This will show you a message that you are not the owner of the universe. Make sure you understand what the warning message means, and you agree to these terms. When you do agree, you can click the green Create universe button. After you clicked this button, the cloning process will take about 10-30 seconds, depending on how big the universe is.  Editing the universe​  If you are the owner of your universe, you can edit it. You can edit the universe by switching the edit mode switch to on. After this you can click and drag on modules or other cells to move them around. To save the current layout, you can press the save button in the top left. You can also resize almost all cells, you do this by first clicking on the cell, selecting it, and dragging the small gray circle on the bottom right. To remove a cell, click on the cell, selecting it, and clicking the red X.  Adding cells to the universe​ Modules​ To add a module to the universe, open the menu on the bottom right by clicking on the red circle menu. Click on Connect module, this will open a dialog where you can search for a module to connect to your universe. Level gates​ To add a level gate to the universe, open the menu on the bottom right by clicking on the red circle menu. Click on New level gate, this will open a dialog where you can set the level for the level gate. Groups​ Groups can be used to visually group certain modules together. We have 2 types of groups, a rectangle, and a circle. These can be added to the universe by clicking on them. Groups also move a bit differently, because they can stack on top of each other. To move a group, you first have to select it, then unlock it by clicking on the lock in the top right, after this you can move the group around.  Labels​ Labels can be used to add text to the universe, these are often used together with a [group](#groups). You can add a label by clicking on the `Tt` icon. Lines and flow​ In order to create a flow inside your universe that the students will follow, you need to connect modules together using lines. This will make the selected module a prerequisite for the module it is connected to. This means that the selected module has to be completed before the student can continue with the module it's been connected to. For example, here the student first has to complete the module HTML / CSS - Beginner before the student can start on HTML / CSS - Advanced  To remove a line between 2 modules, you need to hover over the line, and press the red X button. Start module​ The start module can be selected using the dropdown menu in the top right. This is not only used for the student's tour. The student will also be automatically enrolled in the start module at the end of the tour. So it is highly likely that the student will start here. There can be multiple possible starting points of the universe, every module that does not have a prerequisite line is considered a starting point. Snapping​ To align modules, groups, labels and lines we have introduced a snapping feature. This feature will automatically snap the cell you are moving to adjacent cells.  "}]
