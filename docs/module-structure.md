## Module

At the top of the page you can see the name of the module.
A module in Jarvis has a predefined structure. A module can contain one or more levels. These levels contain one or more
[exercises](exercises/introduction), these exercises can be
either [theoretical](exercises/introduction), [practical](exercises/introduction) or
a [self-diagnostic](exercises/introduction#self-diagnostic).

### Levels

The next level will unlock whenever the previous level has been completed or marked as 'Waiting for review'.

#### Challenge level

A module can also have one challenge level. A challenge level is indicated by the flame icon on the right, and the level
will always be at the end of the module. A challenge level is not mandatory to complete the module.

## Exercise

At the left of the [exercise](exercises/introduction) you can see the name, but also what kind of exercise it
is, [theoretical](exercises/introduction), [practical](exercises/introduction) or
a [self-diagnostic](exercises/introduction#self-diagnostic).

Right of the middle you can see a time indication. This is an estimate of how much time the exercise could take.
