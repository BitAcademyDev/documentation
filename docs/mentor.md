Have coaches mentoring a subsection of students within a group? Or students in different groups?

![Mentor overview](/img/staff/coaches/mentor/mentor-overview.png)

The mentor page can give you an overview of how all your students are doing in the following aspects:

1. Level
2. Attendance
3. Current Track (if enabled on your location)
4. When the student completed their last exercise
5. Who added the last note to the student and when that happend.

If this is not enough you can navigate to the students detail page from here.

:::info
Mentor students can be assigned to a coach by the location administrator.

This option is available via the student detail page `Update student` in the menu in the bottom right.

Below the overview table your students will be graphed against each other.
Showing their level in blue and the amount of exercises they completed in red. 
With the option of filtering the time frame for the graph in the top right corner.
