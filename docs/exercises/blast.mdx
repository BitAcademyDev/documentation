# BLAST

BLAST (or Bit Linting And System Testing), consists of 2 parts [linters](#linting) and [tests](#tests).

Combined these two allow practical code exercises done by students to be automatically reviewed.
Given the exercise has a strict and well-defined outcome.

## Linting
> lint was the name originally given to a particular program that flagged
some suspicious and non-portable constructs (likely to be bugs) in C language source code.
The term is now applied generically to tools that flag suspicious usage in software written in any computer language.

Jarvis supports linting of various programming languages,
including some with differing strictness to allow students to slowly get used to it.

Supported profiles:
- PHP_Lenient
- HTML_Lenient
- CSS
- JS_BROWSER_LENIENT
- JS_BROWSER_STRICT
- SQL_LENIENT
- PYTHON_LENIENT
- C_SHARP
- JAVA

## Tests
BLAST Testing allows us to execute a students code in a secure and sandboxed environment, to validate the outcome.
All possible languages are shown in the dropdown below.

:::note
If your language is not supported you can still use a different language to validate aspects of your students code.

E.g. did they not use the forbidden technique or can I find a specific text in their source code.

### Test utils
Different languages have different testing utilities to help with quickly writing tests.

To offer more insight into the available utils, you can view them here by selecting a language from the dropdown.
