# Feature toggles

Different schools can want their students to have a different experience,
the way to craft this experience in Jarvis is through feature toggles.

These options can be found under `Locations` in the main menu and then the tab `Feature Toggles`

Different feature toggles have different options. Some are only on/off,
some have different settings but all will be accompanied by a description of what that toggle does.

```info
Have a look around, if something seems unclear, feel free to contact dev@bit-academy.nl
```

As can be seen in the screenshot above, some toggles have the ablity to be overriden for specific groups or students.
One useful way to use this is to test out a specific features with a limited amount of students.

```warn
Changes to a feature toggle will become visible within seconds to targeted users
```
