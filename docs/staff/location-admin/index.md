# Intro

As location administrator you can add staff members and students to your location.

## Two-factor
By default, Jarvis requires all staff members to have 2-factor authentication enabled on their accounts.

This is done to add extra protection to the staff members their accounts, 
as they tend to have access to sensible information about students. 

If your organisation really does not want to work with 2-factor authentication, this is your risk to take.
It can be switched off via the [feature toggles](location-admin/feature-toggles).
