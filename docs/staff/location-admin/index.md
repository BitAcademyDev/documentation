# Intro

As location administrator you can create staff members and students for your location.

## Two-factor
By default, Jarvis requires all staff members to have to 2-factor authentication enabled on this account.

This is done to add, extra protection to the staff members their accounts, 
as they tend to have access to a lot from different students. 

If your organisation really don't want to work with 2-factor authentication, this is your risk to take.
It can be switched off via the [feature toggles](location-admin/feature-toggles).
