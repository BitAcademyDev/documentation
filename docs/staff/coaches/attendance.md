# Attendance

Attendance tracking in Jarvis is an optional feature that can function in 2 different modes.

Both modes will show the student a chart in their dashboard of their recorded attendance.

Additionally, if the Chat feature is enabled the student will receive an automated chat message everytime
they get registered as sick, late or unlawfully absent.

## Group

Group mode is the simplest mode, you'll be able to select a group for each day register all students in 1 group.

Works well if you'll only be coaching 1 group of students at a time, and the students get the class schedule elsewhere.

## Schedule

The schedule mode builds on top of the group mode, by adding a schedule for students within Jarvis.

The student will see a widget like this indicating when to when they're expected in class.

When registering attendance you'll no longer go group by group, but you'll be able to register all your students from
different groups from 1 overview. This works best when you have multiple groups of students at the same time.
