# Review samples

## Description
Review samples are there to verify whether reviews were done correctly. They assure the quality of peer reviews, and allow you to reject badly done reviews. 

While executing a review sample, the interface will be very similar to doing a regular review. The main difference is that the buttons to complete the sample are slightly different.

When accepting a review, you get the option of sending feedback to both the author and the reviewer. These feedbacks can be different from each other, allowing you to give taylored feedback for the role the person played in the review.

```warn
Currently it is not possible to accept a review that has been declined unjustly, the author will always need to submit the assignment again once a review has been declined. Rejecting a review sample that unjustly declined a review will not change the state of the exercise for the author
```

When declining a sample you also get the ability to send feedback to both contributors, but on top of this you also get to select a severity of the issue. These range from minor to critical, with minor meaning only the reviewer made a small mistake, and critical being both contributors made grave errors.

The categories are as follows
| Severity | Credits Deducted | Needs to redo exercise |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Minor    | 1                | No                     |
| Normal   | 1                | Yes                    |
| Major    | 3                | Yes                    |
| Critical | 5                | Yes                    |

```warn
Both the author and the reviewer will be deducted the same amount of credits. In case this is not intended, you can manually adjust the credits for the person you want to penalise more (or less) severely
