# Location Administration

As location administrator you are responsible for managing a location. This includes (but is not limited to):
- Creating groups
- [Creating students](../administration/user-management)
- [Creating staff members (and assigning their permissions)](../administration/user-management)
- Assigning staff members to groups
- [Customize the user experience](../administration/feature-toggles)

A location must have at least one location administrator but can have multiple. The location administrators
are the first point of contact for questions related to Jarvis.
